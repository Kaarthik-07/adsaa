# My Project

## Overview
This repository houses my implementation of three fundamental problems in the realm of data structures and algorithms. The problems tackled are Matrix Chain Multiplication, N-Queens, and Bubble Sort, all implemented in Python.

## Problems

### 1. Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **File:** `matrix_chain_multiplication.py`
- **Description:** This module provides an implementation of the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, a classic dynamic programming problem where the goal is to find the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.

### 2. N-Queens
- **File:** `nqueens.py`
- **Description:** The N-Queens problem is addressed in this module, presenting a solution to the challenge of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The implementation utilizes a backtracking approach.

### 3. Bubble Sort
- **File:** `bubble_sort.py`
- **Description:** A simple yet fundamental sorting algorithm, Bubble Sort, is implemented in this module. The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Usage
Each problem is encapsulated in its respective Python file. You can explore and run the solutions independently based on your interest or requirements.

```bash
python matrix_chain_multiplication.py
python nqueens.py
python bubble.py
```
